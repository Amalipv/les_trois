## les trois
Yet another but different kind of To-do Application for organising your work and improving productivity

**les trois** is a to-do application but has three lists to it, instead of a single list.

**-To do** - Has the tasks that are yet to start

**-In Progress** - Tasks that are started but not yet completed

**-Completed** - Tasks that are completed go here.

#### Saved in localStorage
All the tasks are stored in localstorage, hence the data will not be lost.

#### Drag and Drop!
Tasks can be intermoved from one list to another. Say, once a task is started, you can drag and drop to the 'In Progress' panel or to the 'Completed' panel. 
It can be moved back to its original panel too.
